            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                It is a small an lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these 
                environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you flexibility
                    with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                    These unqiue names are called identifiers. <span id="callout">var x;</span>
                </li>

                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee 
                    poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. 
                    <span id="callout">var x = 10;</span>
                </li>

                <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate onvariables you need to know the data type.
                    There are six data types that are JavaScript primatives: Boolean - <span id="callout">true</span> or <span id="callout">false;</span> null - 
                    <span id="callout">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="callout">42</span> or <span id="callout">3.14159;</span> String - 
                    <span id="callout">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span id="callout">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span>
                    and Object - <span id="callout">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform difference actions for different decisions - hitting difference code
                    blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statement in your code to accomplish this.
                    These are the following conditional statements: <span id="callout">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; 
                    <span id="callout">else if</span> to specifiy a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span id="callout">else</span> 
                    we execute this block of code; 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will 
                    repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. 
                    That's a loop!
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="#">Function</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as 
                    a list of instructions. As an example image we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get 
                    started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
                    Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again. 
                </li>
